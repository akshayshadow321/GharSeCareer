# Project Title: Providing Education and Employment Options for Housewives

## Problem Statement
In today's societies, housewives often face issues entering the workforce due to packed schedules and lack of time. Despite possessing a large amount of potential, they often lack access to resources and employment opportunities that they deserve. This project aims to bridge this gap by offering housewives access to online education and employment opportunities, while enabling companies to tap into a pool of skilled workers. Housewives and homemakers will be given more opportunities to shine, thereby empowering women!

## Description
This project is an online platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that connects housewives with educational courses and job opportunities. The platform provides housewives with access to a variety of online courses that help them acquire new skills or enhance existing ones. Additionally, housewives can apply for job postings from companies that require skilled workers and offer work-from-home conditions.

It also provides companies with access to a skilled, untapped workforce, ensuring that they can fill positions that might otherwise be difficult to staff. By using the MERN stack, the platform ensures scalability and provides a seamless experience for all stakeholders. Over time, the platform can expand by offering more courses, job categories, and additional features such as advanced AI assessments or virtual interview tools.
